# V0.2.1 > V1.0.0

Finally version 1 is available now.  
This update can cause error in existing projects if
you use types from this package. Else You can
go with this version too.

### some improvements:

- **Generic Type:** Generic type can be pass while creating `Collection`.
  Generic must be `{string: any}`. This will act as the
  Model or Schema of that collection. This Generic Type
  is for your Type safety.  
  <br>
  **_UseCase:_**

    ```typescript
    import {Collection} from "jsr:@easykv/easykv";
    
    interface schema {
        name: string,
        createdDate: Date
        //  More fields... //
    }
    
    const User = await new Collection<schema>("user")
    ```
- ___Type names were changed:___ EasyKV types were
  Too Ugly. As this going to be a major release, I
  changed the types naming.  
  _For Example:_
    - `EasyKvDataModel` => `EKDataModel`
    - `EasyKvSaveResponse` => `EKSaveResponse`
    - `EasyKvTypes` => `EKTypes`
    -
        -
            *
                -

- More: Some internal Optimizations, Error Handling and
  response were changed. This may not affect your codebase.
